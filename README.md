# Scrap product data from indiamart.com


This project involves web scraping data from a website to collect product information and store it in a CSV file. The purpose of this project is to automate the process of collecting product data for a particular website.

All the required extensions are in requirements.txt file.

The program is designed to scrape data from a single website. If you would like to scrape data from a different website, you will need to modify the code to reflect the structure and formatting of the new website.

To run the program, execute the Python script app.py in your preferred Python environment. Once the program has successfully scraped the data, it will be stored in a CSV file with the name data.csv file.

The program is designed to handle errors gracefully. If the program encounters an error during the scraping process, it will print an error message to the console and terminate.

Please note that web scraping can be a sensitive area and is subject to legal restrictions in certain contexts. Be sure to review the website's terms of use before attempting to scrape data from it, and make sure that your use of the scraped data complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
